### Hi


I'm Ahmad Elsaeed, a second-year computer engineering student at New York University Abu Dhabi.

I am currently taking classes that are software and hardware where I learn the basics of computer building and computer programming. I mainly use C++ to code in class but I have also learned VHDL for hardware coding. I am currently teaching myself blockchain development using Solidity programming language.
